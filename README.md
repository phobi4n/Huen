# Huen
Huen creates a Plasma theme coloured to match your current wallpaper. [Demonstration video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZdZWec-bFk "YouTube") 

## Installation
Huen requires the development packages of Qt 5 and ImageMagick 6.  

To install:

``` 
./install.sh
```

A menu entry should appear under Settings. __N.B.__ If updating from previous version, you must delete ~/.local/share/plasma/desktoptheme/Huen to allow the new theme to be copied over.

## Customisation
Edit "defs.h" to set your own text and background colours.
