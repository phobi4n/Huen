# Huen
Huen creates a Plasma palette based on your current wallpaper. It has two modes of operation; automatic - generates palette by itself, good for running from a launcher on the panel; manual - displays a control panel for you to choose between three sampling methods. 

## Installation
Huen requires the development packages of Qt 5 and ImageMagick 6.  

To install:

``` 
sudo ./install.sh
```

Two  menu entries should appear under Settings. __N.B.__ If updating from previous version, you must delete ~/.local/share/plasma/desktoptheme/Huen to allow the new theme to be copied over.

## Customisation
Edit "defs.h" so set your own text and background colours.
