# Huen
Set Plasma colours from current wallpaper. Requires Qt 5 and ImageMagick 6.
To install:

Two  menu entries should appear under Settings. Huen (control panel) offers three sampling methods. Use whichever you prefer. Huen Auto automatically decides sampling method. This is so you can change the panel with just one click.
